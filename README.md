In the middle of a rewrite. Not published yet...

To do

- the return type of migrate is incorrect
- finish writing the version where you declare your own version
  - ~~make sure the migrations actually work~~
  - ~~make sure you can get the schema out~~
  - make sure there's a way to explicitly say what your type is
- ~~write the tests~~
- try to adjust it so it plugs in nicely with zustand (and jotai? and zod?)
- pick a name and change the root package to that and delete the rest
- make sure there is a way to get the schema out
